## two very simple MCP servers for testing and fun


math_mcp_server.dart Is a math calculator with capability to "wibble" two numbers.

smtp_mcp_server.dart Is a SMTP email sender service, confiuration is done via environment variables.

These were created to test my understanding of MCP and nothing more.
